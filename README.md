Assignment1 has been updated !!
Main() function is in DirWalker.cs
The console asks to enter Directory path (or) Directory Name, the user must enter it.
Output file is "Output/output.csv"
Log file is "logs/logs.txt"

I have used Regular Expressions for validating column values.
I have successfully created a seperate column 'date'
Almost everything is within try{} catch{}
